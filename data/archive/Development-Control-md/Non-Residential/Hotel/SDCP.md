*Special Control Area 2*

Qualified Persons (QPs) should consider the screening requirements in
the early stage of their planning and design to avoid abortive work
subsequently.

Where security screening is deemed necessary, it shall consist of
permanent fixtures that are difficult, if not impossible to remove. The
following screening measures may be considered:

#### Visual Screening

Residential units and common areas may be screened where necessary with
blank walls, external concrete/metal fins, or the building may be
re-orientated such that the windows<sup>1</sup>/openings/balconies do
not have direct view towards the protected area.

<sup>1</sup> **Window**: Raised openings that are at least 0.9m above
the floor slab. They are intended to provide ventilation and lighting,
and not for access. Full height windows and windows that are lower than
0.9m that can potentially be used as access points will need to be
highlighted in the submission plans for URA’s evaluation and approval.

#### Roof Screening

The parapet wall at the rooftop shall be at least 3m high and access to
the rooftop from a public area shall be secured by a lockable
door/hatch. The door/hatch may be electronically linked to an alarm
system monitored by the building management.
