An attic is an incidental space under a sloping roof that functions as
an extension of the unit below. As it is not meant to be an additional
storey, a separate exit at the attic level may only be allowed under the
following circumstances:

-   The attic and the unit below shall not be strata subdivided; and
-   The primary access to the attic shall be from the internal staircase
    to the unit below.

All attic spaces shall adhere to the following requirements:

-   The maximum floor to roof height shall be 5m.
-   The floor of the attic shall be level with the springing
    line<sup>1</sup>, and at least one side of the sloping roof shall
    rest on the springing line (only small openings in the form of
    dormer windows may be allowed on the side of the sloping roof
    resting on the springing line). The Competent Authority may
    determine where the springing line is to be taken from.
-   The maximum allowable pitch of the main roof shall be 45-degrees.
    All roof features, with the exception of dormer windows and 1.0m
    high parapet wall or railings, shall be kept within the 45-degree
    attic roof pitch.

<sup>1</sup> **Springing Line**: The line joining the points on which
the roof rests.
