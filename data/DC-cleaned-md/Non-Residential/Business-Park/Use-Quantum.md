# Use Quantum

## Business Park (Non-White) Component

Quantum Control for land zoned BP

![Quantum Control for land zoned BP](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Business-Park/-/media/CD590CEB29514B8AB6BA4D92DB5BD11F.ashx?h=100%25&w=100%25)

For developments on land zoned BP, minimum 85% of the total GFA of the development shall be retained for BP uses. A maximum 15% of the overall proposed GFA may be allowed for White uses.

For developments on land zoned BP-White, the allowable quantum for White use is higher. The remaining GFA shall be retained for BP uses.

For developments on land zoned BP and BP-White, the BP component is subject to a 60-40 sub-quantum control. For example, a site zoned BP with GPR 2.5 shall provide a minimum 85% BP component to ensure:

- 0.6 x 85% = a minimum of 51% of the BP component shall be allocated to predominant uses
- 0.4 x 85% = a maximum of 34% of the BP component shall be allocated to ancillary uses

#### Guidelines on Industrial Canteen

Industrial canteens within BP industrial developments may include food stalls, cafeteria, food court primarily to serve workers in the BP area and may include members of the public.

These may be approved on Temporary Permission for up to 5 years subject to the following:

- The size of the industrial canteen is capped at 700sqm or 5% of the total proposed GFA of the development, whichever is lower.
- SLA may assess such industrial canteens based on Group D Industrial rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge.

#### Guidelines on Childcare Centre (CCC)

CCCs within BPs are meant to serve parents working in the development. Proposed CCCs may be considered within BP developments, subject to clearances from National Environment Agency and Early Childhood Development Agency. See NEA's webpage [here](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/development-control/guidelines-for-building-plan-submission) and ECDA's webpage [here](https://www.ecda.gov.sg) for more information.

SLA may assess such CCCs based on Group E Civic and Community Institution rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge.

#### Guidelines on Showroom

Showrooms in BPs are meant primarily for the display of two categories of products as follows:

- Products that are not typically transacted or exchanged over the counter (e.g., bulky items such as furniture, motor vehicle); and
- Products that are predominantly delivered and installed off-site (e.g., floor tiles)

Incidental sales of small items or "cash-and-carry" products may be considered only if the main activity of the showroom is for display of the two categories of products listed above.

Showroom proposals will only be considered as part of a Change of Use application, after the building has obtained a Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) and when prospective end-user or business operator for the showroom space is known.

Showrooms may be considered subject to the following:

- Showroom shall be confined to the 1st storey of the development.
- SLA may assess such showrooms based on Group A Commercial rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge.

#### Pollutive Activity

Examples include use or storage of significant quantities of chemicals, use of solid/liquid fuel burning equipment, use of machinery and processes which require pollution control equipment to abate pollution etc.

#### Bad Neighbour Activity

Examples of bad neighbour activities include those involving intense glare or heat exposed to the surroundings, high noise levels, ground vibrations etc.

## White Component

For BP zone, a maximum of 15% of the overall proposed GFA may be allowed for White uses.

For BP-White zone, the White uses may be more than 15% of the overall proposed GFA.

The maximum allowable White quantum in BP-White varies depending on locational criteria such as public accessibility and compatibility with neighbouring land uses. Sites closer to MRT stations may be allowed to have a larger White quantum.

For example, in the map below, the two sites next to Expo MRT Station are zoned BP-White with an allowable GPR of 2.5. The figures in the square brackets indicate the allowable White quantum as reflected on the prevailing Master Plan. Both sites are allowed a maximum of 40% of the overall GFA for White uses.
