Residents may carry out small scale home-based business activities without requiring URA's approval.

The premises must still remain as a residential dwelling and you are reminded to be considerate of your neighbours. Otherwise, you must cease operations or relocate to other premises, such as commercial units.

**Home-based businesses should meet the following criteria:**

1.  The business must be operated by owners, registered occupants or tenants of the property (with consent from the property owners). They are not permitted to allow third parties to operate business in their residential premise and no non-resident employee is allowed to work in the residential premises.
2.  There must be no advertisements, signages, or posters displayed at the residential premises.
3.  No use of heavy equipment or appliances that are not intended for domestic use.
4.  No large-scale storage or frequent loading and unloading of goods, especially for bulky items or use of the residential premises as a distribution centre.
5.  The activities must comply with the rules and regulations of other authorities (e.g. [Singapore Food Agency](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-retail/overview/overviewnew) for food safety and hygiene, Fire Safety and Shelter Department for fire safety requirements)

**Examples of permitted home-based business activities:**

- Food business such as baking on a small scale
- Hairdressing, facial & beauty (excluding massage), manicure, or pedicure services
- Private tuition for not more than three students at a time
- Sewing services
- Work as a freelance artist, journalist, photographer or writer
