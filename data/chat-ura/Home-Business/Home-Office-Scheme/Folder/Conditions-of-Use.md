2.  Up to two non-residents, including employees, partners and directors, are allowed to be engaged in the business at the Home Office unit.
3.  The business should not be on the list of [non-permitted businesses](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Home-Business/Home-Office-Scheme/Folder/Permitted-Non-Permitted-Businesses)Â under the Home Office scheme.
4.  The business activities must not be illegal, unlawful or immoral (e.g. gambling or pornography related activities).
5.  The business activities must not adversely affect the character, ambience and environment of the residential estate.
6.  There must be no solicitation of business that may cause disturbance to the residents or public, (e.g. distribution of brochures, flyers, or door-to-door visitations). There should be no selling of physical goods in or around the residential premises.
7.  There must be no advertisements, signages, or posters displayed at the residential premises.
8.  The applicant must take all necessary safety precautions and ensure that the business activities do not pose any danger to human lives or damage to properties.
9.  Consumption of electricity and structural load must not exceed the normal residential load. Storage and use of dangerous chemicals and/or hazardous substances are strictly prohibited.
10. The business must comply with the regulations of other government authorities and obtain relevant licences/approvals before commencement of business. To search for the licences/approvals that may be required for the business, visit the [GoBusiness Licensing Portal](https://licence1.business.gov.sg/web/frontier/home).
11. No part of the relevant premises should comprise unauthorised works under the Planning Act.
12. In accordance with fire safety requirements set by the Fire Safety and Shelter Department (FSSD), the applicant must install the following in the office area:

    - Minimally an 8A/34B ABC Dry Chemical Powder fire extinguisher (available at DIY shops)
    - A single-station smoke detector (battery operated; no wiring needed; available at DIY shops)

    Note: This FSSD safety requirement is mandatory as the papers, files, and office equipment in a home office pose a slightly higher risk than those of an ordinary dwelling, thus the need for a fire extinguisher and smoke detector. If you have any enquiries on the fire safety requirements, please email [SCDF_qp_consultant@scdf.gov.sg](https://www.ura.gov.sgmailto:SCDF_qp_consultant@scdf.gov.sg).

13. Prior written consent of the owner of the residential premises is required if the person lodging the application form is not the owner.
14. The requisite application fees are payable for the Home Office application.
15. The Home Office registration may be cancelled and the use of the relevant premises as a Home Office shall cease, if there is any breach of the conditions of use.
