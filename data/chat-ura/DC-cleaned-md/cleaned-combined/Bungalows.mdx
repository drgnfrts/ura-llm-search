### Proposals Considered as Additions & Alterations

Proposals shall meet the following criteria to qualify as an Additions & Alterations (A&A) proposal:

- Proposed additional gross floor area shall not exceed 50% of the approved gross floor area;
- External walls that are to be removed and replaced with new walls shall not exceed 50% of the approved external walls;
- Structural changes to the existing landed dwelling house (eg replacing or constructing new columns/beams and reconstructing existing floor slabs) shall not exceed 50% of existing building;
- Changes/replacement of entire roof (with/without resultant increase in height) shall not involve an additional storey;
- Addition of an attic, provided the increase in GFA shall be less than 50%.

### Proposals Considered as Reconstruction

Proposals that do not comply with the criteria for Additions & Alterations shall be considered as Reconstruction proposals. Works resulting in the following outcomes shall also be deemed as reconstruction, regardless of whether the works exceed 50% of the existing building GFA:

- Increase in storey height (including changes/replacement of any part of the roof involving an additional storey);
- Change in landed dwelling housing form (for example, from a semi-detached house to a bungalow).

For existing landed housing approved under previous landed housing guidelines, new Additions and Alterations works shall comply with the permissible building envelope in the Envelope Control guidelines. Where the existing building already exceeds the permissible building envelope, the new Additions and Alterations shall not further increase the building bulk. URA will assess such applications on the merits of the proposal to ensure that the outcome is not worse off.

### Retaining Existing Non-Conforming Structures in Additions and Alterations Proposals

URA may consider allowing landed houses undergoing Additions & Alterations (A&A) works or reconstruction to retain non-conforming structures(1), subject to the following requirements:

- At least 25% of the existing floor plate shall be retained, comprising an integrated wing of existing columns, beams, floor slab and external walls that includes the non-conforming portion of the house;
- Submission of a Professional Engineer’s (PE) certification to confirm that structures to be retained are structurally sound, can accommodate the new works proposed, and that appropriate construction methods will be used to ensure that they will not be damaged
- If the existing front setback is deficient, there shall be a minimum absolute 2.4m setback distance provided from the front boundary line. The setback is measured from the boundary of the external wall/glass of the bay window.

URA shall be notified immediately if any of the non-conforming structures approved to be retained are demolished. The Qualified Person appointed by the owner shall make an amendment application for the new works to comply with prevailing DC guidelines, before any new works are carried out on site.

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Non-conforming Structures: Structures within the existing house that were approved and built in the past, but do not comply with the prevailing development control guidelines.

- The car porch roof may be used as a balcony or garden, but it shall remain open-to-sky and unenclosed area. Only the following may be allowed on the car porch roof:
  - a. A maximum 1m high parapet wall around the perimeter of the car porch roof, constructed of visually porous material (eg tempered glass and railing);
  - b. A maximum 1m wide sun shading canopy, cantilevered from the building wall to provide weather protection for the opening to the car porch roof;
  - c. Planters for landscaping.

### Minor Building Appendages

Maximum allowable protrusion of minor building appendages into road buffer and common boundary setbacks

While the building appendages may be within the permissible building envelope, such features may require further evaluation depending on the site context, to ensure that they do not substantially add to the building bulk.
Maximum allowable protrusion of minor building appendages into road buffer and common boundary setbacks.

| Appendage                                                                                                               | Within GCBA I                                               | Outside GCBA                                                         |

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Secondary roof eaves may only extend 1m beyond the permissible building envelope.
- (2): The maximum projection (i.e. 1m or 1.4m) into the road buffer or into the common boundary setback applies to retractable awnings when they are fully stretched out (i.e. not when the awnings are in their retracted positions).
- (3) Minor decorative feature examples includes light weight cantilevered screens spaced apart for sun-shading purpose without vertical supports. All such structural projections shall not exceed 500mm in depth.
- (4) Planter Boxes: cantilevered box structures for planting purposes.
- (5) Bay Windows: Raised windows not exceeding one structural bay width and cantilevered at least 0.5m high from the floor.
- While the building appendages may be within the permissible building envelope, such features may require further evaluation depending on the site context, to ensure that they do not substantially add to building bulk.
- If the plot abuts a GCBA plot, the minimum setback is 3m.
- These standards are based on Cat 3-5 roads. Setback requirement for other building features not covered under the table shall be assessed on the merits of the proposal.



## Envelope Control Guidelines

Envelope Control Guidelines

![Envelope Control Guidelines](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/SD04B_Envelope_Control_3D_Fins.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

From 11 May 2015, landed housing shall follow the envelope control guidelines. The guidelines define an allowable building envelope based on storey height and building setbacks. The development shall not exceed the permissible building envelope as illustrated in figure above.

For existing landed housing approved under previous conventional landed housing guidelines, new Additions and Alterations works shall comply with the permissible building envelope in the Envelope Control guidelines.

Where the existing building already exceeds the permissible building envelope, the new Additions and Alterations shall not further increase the building bulk. URA will assess such applications on the merits of the proposal.

### Building Height

Under the envelope control guidelines, the overall building height is based on the allowable number of storeys and the floor-to-floor height in metres. The figures below show the building envelope and the relationship between storey height and allowable building height in metres.

- Landed housing shall not exceed the 2-storey or 3-storey height control, or the prescribed storey height as shown in the designated landed housing plan in the Master Plan, whichever is lower. This is to ensure that the height of the development is sympathetic to the existing character(1) of landed housing in the neighbourhood.
- The allowable building height is measured from the external platform level. If there is an existing level difference within the site, the allowable building envelope height may be taken separately from the two distinct platform levels.
- Lift overrun and safety barriers at RC flat roofs may be considered up to 1m beyond the allowable building height.

2-storey Envelope Control landed housing

![2-storey Envelope Control landed housing](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Bungalows/LHD11-Envelope-control-2styedited10aug21LHD09A-Envelope-control-2sty.jpg?h=327&w=800)

3-storey Envelope Control landed housing

![3-storey Envelope Control landed housing](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Bungalows/LHD12-Envelope-control-3sty10aug21LHD09B-Envelope-control-3sty.jpg?h=373&w=800)

- (1)Other height controls may also be applicable, such as:
  - Absolute technical height constraints(@) (eg Aviation paths restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).
  - Conservation guidelines (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
  - Urban design height controls (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
  - (@) The absolute technical height (Based on Singapore Height Datum [SHD]) shall take precedence if it is stricter than any of the other height controls.

### Mezzanine Floors

Mezzanine floors are no longer required to be kept to below 50% of a typical floor plate, and there are no restrictions on window openings on the front façade of the mezzanine floors.

Landed houses with mezzanine floors shall be designed within the permissible building envelope stipulated for the landed housing estate it is located in (ie maximum 12 m overall height for a designated two-storey landed housing estate and 15.5 m for a designated three-storey landed housing estate). The headroom proposed for each floor shall promote good internal spatial quality for residential living.

Guidelines for Mezzanine Floor

![Guidelines for Mezzanine Floor](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD17_Mezzanine.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

### Attics

An attic is an incidental space that may be allowed within the permissible two-storey and three-storey envelopes respectively. Where roof terraces are proposed on attic roofs, they shall be located at least 3m below the top extent of the permissible building envelope to ensure future coverings by homeowners remain within the overall building envelope. Roofs with less than 3m below the top extent of the permissible building envelope shall be proposed as RC flat roofs that are non-accessible except for maintenance purposes.

Attic Guidelines

The side of a basement wall abutting any site boundary shall not have any openings into the adjoining site. |

- (2) Road Reserve: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

#### Basements in Low-lying Areas

For sites in low lying landed housing areas, internal areas below the minimum platform level (MPL)(3) shall be treated as a basement storey and shall not count as an additional storey, subject to:

- Any building structures or internal living areas proposed below the MPL shall be fully sealed with no external openings(4).
- Overall allowable height (based on the envelope control guidelines for landed houses) shall be measured from the MPL applicable for the site. The car porch roof shall be kept to maximum of 4.5m above the external ground level.

Where the MPL requirement is significantly higher than the existing levels of adjacent sites or roads, and the existing ground levels shall be retained, any building structures/internal spaces that are below the MPL but above the existing ground levels shall comply fully with the main building road buffer and setback requirements. They shall not be built up to the site lot boundary.

Basement guidelines for low-lying sites

![Basement guidelines for low-lying sites](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD16_Height_MPL_2D.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

- (3): Minimum Platform Level (MPL): The minimum 1st storey level to be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).
- (4): If external openings are proposed, additional requirements from PUB shall be complied with, as follows:
  - The internal finished floor level shall be at least 300mm above the adjacent road level; and
  - Only entrance driveways, bin centres, turfed compound area, car porches or any other areas as may be approved by PUB may be permitted below the MPL. Bedrooms and M&E installations shall be located above the MPL.

#### Basements on Sloping Sites

For plots with sloping ground, exposed basement protrusion above existing ground level may be considered as shown in the figure below as long as the basement protrusion is kept within the permissible Envelope Control building height.

Basement Protrusion for Sloping Sites

title: Earthworks
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Bungalows/Earthworks
date: 5 July 2019
---

Earthworks are defined as any operations or works in, on, or over land which result in substantial modification to the existing ground terrain, land form, or slope. These include excavation, formation of a new slope or embankment, and cut and fill operations.

Earthworks involving earthcut or earthfill shall be minimised to avoid excessive changes to the existing terrain. The scale of earthworks allowed depends on the location and purpose of the proposed earthworks. All proposed earthworks shall be evaluated to ensure they are sensitive to the wider site context and its impact to the surrounding developments.

Allowable Earthworks

![Allowable Earthworks](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD08_Earthworks_Allowable_Earth_Cut.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

### Earthworks for the Entire Development Site

Earthworks to raise the existing platform level of the entire development site are generally not allowed. This is to avoid creating new retaining walls.

### Earthworks within the Building Setback Area

Earthworks are generally not allowed within the road buffer/building setbacks. Any proposed earthworks shall be assessed based on site context. Where allowed, they shall not exceed 1m.

Earthworks of more than 1m to meet PUB MPL(1) shall be assessed on the merits of the proposal. Refer to earthworks in low-lying areas sub-section.

Earthworks may also be considered to:

- Create a vehicular access of maximum **4m** wide;
- Match the existing platform levels of the neighbouring sites.
- Create a workable platform level to mitigate level differences within an undulating or sloping site, or between the site and road.
- Facilitate building of a fully submerged basement. The area within the building setback distances shall be reinstated to the original platform level upon the completion of the basement.

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Minimum Platform Level (MPL): The minimum 1st storey level to be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).

### Earthworks within the Buildable Area

The proposed works shall be evaluated in relation to the permissible building envelope under the [Envelope Control guidelines](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/EC).

### Earthworks in Low-Lying Areas

For low-lying sites that need to meet PUB's Minimum Platform Level (MPL):

- Only the building structures or internal living areas and side/rear setback areas shall be raised to meet the stipulated MPL.
- The road buffer area of the development site need not be raised to the required MPL. For flood protection purposes, the road buffer area has to be 300mm above the adjacent road level, or not lower than the existing ground level, whichever is higher.
- Any common retaining-cum-boundary walls or fences shall be designed sensitively, as these may be higher than the existing levels of adjacent houses or land parcels.
- The following condition shall be annotated on plans: "The Developer/Owner is fully aware that he shall raise the structures/areas built to lower platform levels, to or above the recommended Minimum Platform Level as and when the adjacent grounds/roads are raised in future and comply with any other conditions deemed necessary by PUB."

Refer to [Basements](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/EC) section for more information on the treatment of internal areas below the MPL.

![Illustration of a Detached House](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD00_Bungalow_Typology.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

A bungalow is a detached landed house with its own land title(1). It may be built in areas designated for landed housing developments or on land zoned for residential use if the development site area meets the minimum plot size, plot width, and site coverage requirements for a bungalow development.

Bungalows may be built in any designated landed housing area, including semi-detached housing or mixed landed housing areas. In Good Class Bungalow Areas (GCBA) or in other bungalow areas, only bungalow developments are allowed.

At the individual plot level, a bungalow development shall adhere to the envelope control guidelines. These guidelines set out the allowable building envelope based on applicable storey height controls and building setback requirements. The allowable Gross Floor Area (GFA) for landed housing is resultant of the allowable building height and envelope.

### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Strata-Titled Bungalows: Bungalows may be strata-titled when approved as strata bungalows – refer to [Strata Landed Housing handbook](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Strata-Landed-Housing) for guidelines and requirements.

## Open Space Provision
---
title: Open Space Provision
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Bungalows/Open-Space-Provision
date: 5 July 2019
---

The National Parks Board (NParks) requires new landed housing development clusters of a certain total Gross Floor Area (GFA) to set aside an open space plot at a rate of 4.05sqm of open space for every 56sqm of gross floor area(1).

While the minimum open space plot size required is 1,000sqm (i.e., a landed housing development with a total gross floor area of about 13,800sqm would be required to make such provision), NParks may require a smaller open space plot based on the same computation rate depending on the adequacy of open space in the nearby area.

The open space plot shall be vested in the State before the Building & Construction Authority (BCA) issues a Certificate of Statutory Completion (CSC). The open space shall be free from encumbrances, unless otherwise specified, before it can be vested in the State.

The open space provided shall be:

- Suitably located within the proposed development, such that it is conveniently accessible to the public;
- A single plot of a regular shape and not fragmented (e.g., by road, drain or other reserves); and
- Generally flat terrain that is neither low-lying nor subject to flooding.

Where the landed housing development cluster abuts an expressway or major arterial road, part of the open space provision may double up as part of the buffer zone provided the:

- Depth of the open space plot is 3m (minimum); and
- Configuration or the open space plot is reasonably regular.

- (1) The Open Space Provision requirements are not applicable for Strata Landed Housing developments. See [Strata Landed Housing](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Strata-Landed-Housing/Site-Coverage) Communal Open Space and greenery provision requirements.


## Plot Size and Width for Bungalows
---
title: Plot Size and Width for Bungalows
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Bungalows/Plot-Size-Width
date: 8 April 2024
---

The plot size and width refers to the net dimension and area of the plot excluding the land required to be set aside for vesting to the State e.g. excluding Drainage Reserve (DR) and/or Road Reserve (RR).

Plot Size and Width

![Plot Size and Width](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD01_Bungalow_Plot_Size.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

### Guidelines for Plot Size and Width

#### Bungalows (Within GCBA)

| Location                 | Plot Size (Minimum) | Plot Width (Minimum) | Plot Depth (Minimum) |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Bungalows (Within GCBA)  | 1,400sqm            | 18.5m                | 30m                  |
| Bungalows (Outside GCBA) | 400sqm              | 10m                  | No Minimum           |

### Bungalows (within GCBA) - Variations in plot dimensions

Variations in plot width, depth and size may be considered under the following circumstances.

- The proposed development site is an in-fill development on an existing plot which is already deficient in plot size (ie less than 1,400sqm).
- For proposals arising from amalgamation and subdivision of GCBA lots, only one new residual plot with deficient plot size (ie less than 1,400sqm) shall be allowed per amalgamation and subdivision proposal. The shortfall in the deficient plot size shall be due to vesting of land for public purpose (eg for road widening), and the shortfall in that plot size shall be less than 10%. All proposed new bungalows shall comply with the requisite site coverage and building setback requirements for GCBs.
- For proposals arising from a subdivision of GCBA lots containing conserved bungalows, the plot sizes of the new plot and the conserved bungalow plot shall be at least 2,800sqm (after setting aside for road widening/drainage reserve(1), etc). Only one new residual plot with deficient plot size (less than 1,400sqm) of not less than 1,000sqm shall be allowed per conserved bungalow.

- (1) Drainage Reserve (DR): An area safeguarded for purposes of building or widening a public drain.

![Allowed](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Redevelopment/LH_Fig15_Subdivision_Conserved_Bungalow_GCBA_A.jpg)

Allowed: The proposed subdivision of land results in only one deficient plot, which is contiguous with Plot 1 (containing conserved bungalow). The other subdivided plots (Plot 3 to 6) comply with the minimum plot size of 1,400sqm and the total size of Plot 1 and Plot 2 is more than 2,800sqm.

![Allowed](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Redevelopment/LH_Fig16_Subdivision_Conserved_Bungalow_GCBA_NA.jpg)

Not Allowed: The proposed subdivision of land results in more than one plot with deficient plot size (less than 1,400sqm)

### Bungalows (outside GCBA) - Variations in plot width

For bungalow plots of irregular shape within existing landed housing estates, slight deficiency in plot width may be considered provided:

- The average width of the plot remains at least 10m so as to allow for a meaningful building footprint and internal layout;
- The absolute minimum plot width at its narrowest shall be 4m; and
- The plot shall fully comply with the minimum plot size control and all other development control guidelines (eg setback, road buffer, etc).

Examples of irregular-shaped plots allowed

![Examples of irregular-shaped plots allowed](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Redevelopment/LH_Fig176_Irregular-shaped_Plots_A.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

The deficiency in plot width, if allowed, is restricted to one new plot per development provided it is a new residual plot (ie all other plots within the same development shall comply fully with the minimum plot width).



## RC Flat Roofs
---
title: RC Flat Roofs
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Bungalows/RC-Flat-Roofs
date: 27 June 2022
---

### Introduction

RC flat roofs shall remain inaccessible except for maintenance purposes only(1). Activating the rooftop for uses such as roof terraces and landscaped gardens may be allowed depending on the merits of the proposal. No structures shall be allowed unless otherwise approved by URA. Where allowed, structures (including any safety barriers) shall comply with height controls(2) and the following guidelines.

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): RC flat roofs that are accessible via ladders for maintenance purposes only are subject to agencies’ requirements for safety barriers to ensure the safety of maintenance personnel. Safety barriers shall not exceed 1m in height and may be considered beyond the permissible building envelope.
- (2): Height controls applicable, include:
  - Absolute technical height constraints(@) (e.g. Aviation paths restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).
  - Conservation guidelines (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
  - Urban design height controls (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
- (@): The absolute technical height (Based on Singapore Height Datum [SHD]) shall take precedence if it is stricter than any of the other height controls.

### Solar Panels

The installation of solar panels on RC flat roofs may be considered if they meet the following criteria:

- a. Solar panels are installed between 10 to 15 degrees relative to the horizontal plane to optimise the performance of solar panels and minimise glare to the buildings in the vicinity; and
- b. The installation of solar panels shall not result in the removal of any greenery approved under the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH) Programme.

Installation of solar panels and M&E equipment such as inverters for the solar panel system does not require planning permission except in locations and contexts described below.

#### Planning Permission

- a. Areas subject to urban design guidelines and Conservation Areas(1) shall require planning permission due to their impact on the roofscape.

- b. Elevated solar panels(2) located in developments on the following land use zones shall require planning permission:

  - Residential (landed housing, flats and condominium housing developments)
  - Residential with Commercial at 1st Storey
  - Mixed Commercial & Residential
  - Commercial
  - Hotel
  - White
  - Residential / Institution
  - Commercial / Institution
  - Educational Institution
  - Place of Worship
  - Civic & Community Institution

- c. Spaces under solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial use
  - Planning permission shall be required if the spaces under elevated or non-elevated solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial uses such as Outdoor Refreshment Areas. In such instances, the spaces shall be computed as GFA.

#### Assessment of Storey Height

Elevated solar panels that require planning permission may be assessed as an additional storey for storey height control purposes unless they comply with the guidelines below:

Guidelines for Elevated Solar Panels

| Parameter | Guidelines                                                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Extent    | Within the 45-degree line from the springing line of the roof level |
| Height    | Maximum 5m above roof level                                         |

![Extent and Height of Elevated Solar Panels](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/GFA55_Solar_Panels_Landed.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): For Conservation Areas, installation of solar panels without any additional works are treated as localised works for the purpose of repair and maintenance and are considered Category 3 works for Conserved Buildings. Applications for such Category 3 works can be made by owners and contractors. Refer to the Conservation Guidelines [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation) and information on submission procedure [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation/Additions-Alterations/Types-Works).
- (2): A solar panel is deemed to be elevated if it is raised more than 1m from the roof level for landed housing developments or 1.8m from the roof level for other developments.

### Retaining Walls

Outward facing retaining walls are not encouraged as they tend to mar the streetscape. If allowed, retaining walls shall:

- Not be more than 1m high. Retaining walls more than 1m high may be considered along the common boundaries and shall be suitably tiered and planted with adequate greenery if alternative measures are impractical.
- Be terraced at minimum 300mm apart, and planted to give an adequate greenery effect, if fronting a road or street.

### Boundary Walls

Boundary walls shall not exceed 1.8m high.

The combined height of the retaining and boundary wall shall not exceed 2.8m, of which the solid wall shall not exceed 1.8m. Where a boundary wall is proposed on top of the retaining wall, only porous material (e.g., fencing) shall be used for the boundary wall.

Refer to Ancillary Structures sub-section for the setback requirement for minor structures, [Basements](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Bungalows/EC) section for basement setbacks, and [Building Appendages](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Bungalows/Building-Appendages) section for allowable encroachment of minor building features into the setback areas.

### Setbacks for an existing individual plot outside GCBA with more than one road frontage

For an individual plot with more than one road frontage, the building setback requirements are shown in the figures below.

Setbacks for a bungalow with more than 1 road frontage (Non-Cat 5 roads)

![Setbacks for a bungalow with more than 1 road frontage (Non-Cat 5 roads)](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD05_Setbacks_Multiple_Road_Frontages.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

Setbacks for a bungalow with more than 1 road frontage (Cat 5 roads)

### Setbacks for existing irregular or odd-shaped plots (excluding newly created) outside GCBA

For already existing irregular or odd-shaped plots (excluding newly created ones) outside GCBA, the standard 7.5m building setback from a road shall apply for a width of 8m, measured from the common boundary line with the adjoining neighbour. Beyond the 8m width, a reduced 2m building setback may be allowed, except for the car porch which requires a 2.4m setback.

![Setbacks for irregular/odd-shaped plots outside GCBA](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD07_Setbacks_Odd_Shaped_Plots.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

A plot is deemed irregular or odd-shaped if:

- It is an already existing plot configuration; not newly created through subdivision,
- The an odd-shaped site is fronting a minor road (ie category 4 or 5),
- The resultant building footprint cannot achieve a meaningful layout after complying with the standard 7.5m road buffer requirement.

#### Examples where Reduced Setbacks do not apply

![https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Redevelopment/LH_Fig182a_Redevelopment_NA.jpg](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Redevelopment/LH_Fig182a_Redevelopment_NA.jpg)

B1 & B2 are newly created constrained plots. Such new subdivisions are not eligible to apply the reduced front setback guideline.

### Rear Garden Landed Housing

"Rear garden" landed housing allows for a larger garden at the rear, with a narrower setback from the road. This orientation is a reversal of conventional guidelines which require landed housing developments to be setback 7.5m from the road reserve(2) line. Houses with rear gardens shall be sited within their own enclave, and segregated from the rest of the estate with their own access road.

Rear garden landed housing may be allowed within new landed housing enclaves that are designated for such a layout. Otherwise, the guidelines are generally applicable within the existing estates of [Hong Leong Garden](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Hong-Leong-Garden-Estate.pdf) (PDF, 1.22 MB), [Clementi Green Estate](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Clementi-Green-Estate.pdf) (PDF, 1.05 MB), [Changi Heights](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Changi-Heights.pdf) (PDF, 1.25 MB), [Lasia Avenue](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Lasia-Avenue.pdf) (PDF, 1.15 MB), [Peach Garden](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Peach-Garden.pdf) (PDF, 1.18 MB), [The Inglewood](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2018/Nov/dc18-10/dc18-10-Annex-1.pdf) (part) (PDF, 134 KB), [Ford Avenue](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Ford-Avenue.pdf) (PDF, 1.11 MB) and [Yuk Tong Avenue](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Yuk-Tong-Avenue.pdf) (PDF, 1.04 MB).

The setback controls for Rear Garden housing are as follows:

## Site Coverage
---
title: Site Coverage
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Bungalows/Site-Coverage
date: 5 July 2019
---

Site coverage is computed based on the footprint of the building and coverage of all building features (raised 1m or more above ground level) when viewed from above.

[Site Coverage Plan Example for a Detached House](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/SC02_Site_Coverage_Plan_House.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

Guidelines on Site Coverage for Bungalows

| Location     | Site Coverage (Maximum) |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| Within GCBA  | 40%                     |
| Outside GCBA | 50%                     |



## Special and Detailed Control Plans

Special and Detailed Control Plans (SDCP) provide detailed guidelines for specific areas. The SDCPs may be viewed [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/index.html?service=CTRLPLAN).

### Special Control Areas

The following areas may be subject to security screening requirements. URA will confirm this upon submission of a proposed development.

Special Control Area 1

![Link to Special Control Area 1 Image](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Special-Control-Area-1.jpg?h=416&w=750)

Special Control Area 2

[Link to Special Control Area 2 Image](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Special-Control-Area-2.jpg?h=383&w=750)

Qualified Persons (QPs) should consider the screening requirements in the early stage of their planning and design to avoid abortive work subsequently.

Where security screening is deemed necessary, it shall consist of permanent fixtures that are difficult, if not impossible to remove. The following screening measures may be considered:

#### Visual Screening

Residential units and common areas may be screened where necessary with blank walls, external concrete/metal fins, or the building may be re-orientated such that the windows(1)/openings/balconies do not have direct view towards the protected area.

##### Definitions and Notes

- (1) Window: Raised openings that are at least 0.9m above the floor slab. They are intended to provide ventilation and lighting, and not for access. Full height windows and windows that are lower than 0.9m that can potentially be used as access points will need to be highlighted in the submission plans for URA’s evaluation and approval.

#### Roof Screening

The parapet wall at the rooftop shall be at least 3m high and access to the rooftop from a public area shall be secured by a lockable door/hatch. The door/hatch may be electronically linked to an alarm system monitored by the building management.
