| Sunken basement          | Up to the road reserve(1) line, provided the portion underneath the green buffer is submerged at least 2m or more below the ground level | Up to the site lot boundary, provided: the portion underneath the 2m tree planting strip is submerged at least 2m or more below the ground level; there are no technical requirements (e.g., sewerage, drainage) and the basement does not cause any adverse impact to the adjoining property; the side of a basement wall abutting any site boundary shall not have any openings into the adjoining site. |

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1) **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

### Vertical Openings

Basements with vertical openings on the side walls may be allowed only if they are required for natural ventilation and to meet the building regulations. The guidelines are as follows:

- While the protrusion measured from the level at the site boundary shall not exceed 1.0m, basements may be exposed up to 2.0 m from the point where the platform level meets the basement wall (i.e., the earth around the basement wall may be cut to slope down to achieve the 2.0m basement exposure with openings).
- The extent of the slope within the green buffer or planting strip shall have a gradient of 1:2.5.
- Vertical cutting of the earth resulting in a trench around the basement is not allowed.
- The extent of the vertical openings or the types of cover over the vertical openings shall be subject to the requirements of the other technical departments.
- Horizontal openings to the basement are allowed within the setback distance outside the green buffer and planting strip, subject to provision of effective screening to hide the view to the basement.

Building Height

![Building Height](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Hotel/H06_Building_Height.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

The overall building height for hotel developments are determined by the number of storeys and the prescribed floor-to-floor height.

### Number of Storeys

The number of storeys for hotel developments is guided by the [building height plan](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=BH).

If the storey height is not specified in the building height plan, the number of storeys would be evaluated by taking into consideration the location, site context, site topography, and impact of the hotel development on the surroundings.

Basement storeys that protrude more than 1.0m above ground level on any side shall be counted as a storey.

### Floor-to-Floor Height for Hotel Developments

The maximum floor-to-floor height for hotel developments is 5m, including the mezzanine floor.

Variations in floor-to-floor height are subject to evaluation depending on the use and location of the floor. If permitted, the proposed building height shall not exceed the maximum building height control computed based on the permitted number of storeys.

### Overall Building Height Control

Unless otherwise stated, the overall building height of hotel developments is subject to compliance with the technical height controls of the relevant agencies such as Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA).

Building height is based on Singapore Height Datum (SHD).

### Additional Height for Predominant Sky Terrace Storey

Additional Height for Predominant Sky Terrace Storeys

![Additional Height for Predominant Sky Terrace Storeys Image](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C04_Additional_Height_for_Sky_Terrace_Floors.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

Predominant Sky Terrace Storeys (PSTS) are floors where the sky terrace areas within the 45-degree line occupy at least 60% of the floor plate.

If the proposed number of storeys in the development is more than 7 storeys, commercial developments with PSTS may be allowed additional building height depending on the number of storeys proposed as shown in the table below:

Additional Building Height based on Proposed Storey Height

| Proposed Storey Height of Development | Additional Building Height Allowed |
| :-----------------------------------: | :--------------------------------: |
|                7 - 20                 |               10.0m                |
|                21 - 30                |               15.0m                |
|                31 - 40                |               20.0m                |
|                41 - 50                |               25.0m                |
|             More than 50              |               30.0m                |

The additional building height may only be distributed to the sky terrace floors within the development.

Spaces for M&E services located directly beneath the sky terrace floor may be included in the additional height.

The overall building height is subject to technical height controls.

The additional building height shall not apply to:

- a. Developments within Conservation Areas and sites with National Monuments;
- b. Developments with height control of 6 storeys or less; or
- c. Developments with special controls e.g. areas with street block plans.

In addition to (a) – (c), any additional building height will be subject to evaluation for developments adjacent to conserved buildings or in [urban design areas](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design) with site-specific height considerations.

All buildings in hotel developments shall be sufficiently set back from the road and common boundary. The setback distance is measured from the road reserve1 line or boundary line to the external wall of the buildings, excluding land to be vested to the State for road and/or drainage purpose.

All buildings in hotel developments fronting a public road shall provide a road buffer, the width of which depends on the hierarchy of the road. A green buffer shall be set aside in the road buffer depending on the width of the road buffer.

The buffer requirements for the Road Categories 1 to 5 are in the tables below.

### Definitions and Notes

- (1) Road Reserve: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

### Road Buffer and Green Buffer

| Road Category                | Road Buffer (inclusive of Green Buffer in brackets) |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Category 1                   | 15m (5m)                                            |
| Category 2                   | 7.5m (3m)                                           |

## Provision of Open and Covered Public Walkways
---
title: Provision of Open and Covered Public Walkways
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Hotel/Covered-Walkways
date: 5 July 2019
---

All hotel developments shall provide covered walkways along the periphery of the building facing roads and pedestrian routes.

Covered walkways for hotel developments in the Central Area may be guided by urban design requirements. These urban design requirements shall take precedence over the standard development control parameters.

The specific urban design requirements for each planning area within the Central Area can be found on our [Urban Design](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design) Website.

### Height of Covered Walkways

The soffit height of covered walkways is 3.6m.

Where higher ceiling height is desired, glass or other cladding may be provided at the edge of the covered walkway to achieve the 3.6m height.

A higher soffit height may be allowed in independent developments provided the walkway width is increased correspondingly to maintain the 45-degree angle, at main entrances to facilitate articulation, and on urban design grounds.

### Width of Covered Walkways

The minimum width for covered walkways varies depending on the location of the site and proximity to transport nodes. These are subject to urban design guidelines for selected locations with higher footfall eg Central Area, Regional Centres, and Key Growth Areas. For walkways wider than the minimum requirement, GFA exemption may be considered depending on merits of the proposal.

Covered Walkway Width Requirements

| Types of Linkages                                                              | Minimum Overall Width | Minimum Clear Width |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Walkways within the Central Area or 200m of MRT stations/major transport nodes | 3.6m                  | 3m                  |
| Walkways between 200 – 400m of MRT stations/major transport nodes              | 3m                    | 2.4m                |
| All other walkways                                                             | 2.4m                  | 2m                  |

[Covered Walkways Image](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C20_Covered_Walkways.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

### Location & Design of Covered Walkways

Covered walkways shall be provided at the periphery of the buildings next to or facing public roads.

The walkways shall be continuous, providing connections into the interior of the building, open space or open walkway. All ramps leading into the interior of the building shall begin outside the covered walkway.

Covered walkways shall be seamlessly connected to adjoining developments. Covered linkways shall be provided between non-party wall(1) developments.

All level differences within the covered walkways shall be mitigated with ramps and not steps. For covered linkways between developments, steps are only allowed for steep gradient where ramping is not possible. All ramps leading into the interior of the building shall begin outside the covered walkway.

Covered walkways shall be kept free from all obstructions. All building services and services which may cause obstruction when maintenance works are being carried out shall be located within the building.

### Platform Level of Covered Walkways

The platform level of covered walkways shall match the platform level of the open walkways.

- For open walkways that are at or to be raised to the Minimum Platform Level(1)
  ![Open Walkways at or to be raised to the Minimum Platform Level](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C11_Covered_Walkways_MPL_A.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

The covered walkways shall be built to the minimum platform level or other level stipulated by PUB so that they match the existing or proposed platform level of the open walkways.

Steps or ramps shall be provided to link to covered walkways in adjacent buildings which are not raised. The steps or ramps shall be levelled when the adjacent buildings are raised.

- For open walkways that are below the Minimum Platform Level
  ![Open Walkways below the Minimum Platform Level](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C12_Covered_Walkways_MPL_B.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

The covered walkways may be allowed below the minimum platform level or other level stipulated by PUB so that they match the existing platform level of the open walkways.

The first storey of the building shall be raised to the minimum platform level, with provision of steps or ramps for access.

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1) Minimum Platform Level (MPL): The minimum 1st storey level to be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).



## Earthworks, Retaining Walls, and Boundary Walls

title: Earthworks, Retaining Walls, and Boundary Walls
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Hotel/Earthworks
date: 5 July 2019
---

### Earthworks

Earthworks are defined as any operations or works in, on, or over land which result in substantial modification to the existing ground terrain, land form, or slope. These include excavation, formation of a new slope or embankment, and cut and fill operations.

Extensive earthworks are discouraged as it may change the existing terrain. Earthworks may also result in the building of high retaining walls that mar the streetscape and have adverse impacts on the surrounding areas. Earthworks on any development site, where necessary, shall be minimised.

Planning permission is required if earthworks involve more than 2,000sqm of land or change in the level of the land of more than 1.5m anywhere in the development site or relative to the neighbouring land.

The guidelines for earthworks are dependent on where the earthworks are carried out.

Location of Allowable Earthworks:

![Location of Allowable Earthworks](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C07_Earthworks.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

#### Earthworks within the Building Setback Area

Earthworks may not be allowed within the building setback area, except in specific circumstances:

- When the proposed earthworks are to match the existing platform levels of the neighbouring sites;
- When the sites are on undulating or sloping terrain, with large differences in platform levels within the site, or between the site and the road;
- When the earthcut is necessary to build a fully submerged basement. The area within the building setback shall be reinstated to the original platform level upon the completion of the basement.

#### Earthworks within the Build-able Area (i.e. outside the Building Setback Area)

Earthworks within the build-able area of more than 1m are subject to evaluation depending on merits. If the earthfill of more than 1m is allowed, the earthfilled area shall not be counted as an additional storey provided the overall aggregate building height complies with the maximum allowable building height measured from the allowable platform level.

#### Earthworks within the Entire Development Site

Earthfill involving the entire development site may only be considered if the proposed earthworks are required to meet the technical requirements of PUB. Such earthfill may be allowed up to the Minimum Platform Level (MPL)(1).

##### Definitions and Notes:

- (1) Minimum Platform Level (MPL): The minimum 1st storey level to be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).

### Retaining & Boundary Walls

Allowable Height of Retaining and Boundary Walls:
![Image](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F15_Retaining_Wall_15m.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

The maximum allowable height for boundary walls is 1.8m.

High retaining walls shall be avoided wherever possible, particularly for small in-fill plots. If they have to be built and can be allowed, they shall meet specific requirements:

- The height shall be less than 1.5m;
- Retaining walls higher than 1.5m may be considered due to site constraints and the need for extensive excavation;
- The total visible height of the solid boundary-cum-retaining wall shall not exceed 2.8m, of which the solid boundary wall shall not exceed 1.8m.

If the retaining walls are to meet the MPL requirement stipulated by PUB for drainage purposes, the retaining walls along the site boundaries (except along boundaries that abut foreshore, roads, or waterbodies with drainage reserve equal to or more than 17.5m wide) need not be tiered as these are transitory, pending the redevelopment of the neighbouring land to the same MPL.

Hotel developments are eligible for bonus GFA if they satisfy the requirements of the following incentive schemes:

### Balcony Incentive Scheme

The GFA of balconies in hotel developments may be computed over and above the Master MP allowable GPR, subject to a cap of 10% inclusive of planter boxes, if any. The additional GPR may only be used for balcony GFA and shall not form the future development potential of the site upon redevelopment. The additional balcony GFA may be subject to SLA levying Land Betterment Charge, where applicable. When submitting development proposals with balconies, the QP is required to demarcate the balcony area clearly on the Calculation Plan and declare the total balcony area that exceeds the MP allowable GPR.

Existing developments whose GPR have exceeded the Master Plan intensity may qualify for the additional balcony GFA, subject to a cap of 10% of the existing and approved GPR inclusive of planter boxes, if any. This does not apply to existing developments whose building form, height, or use are not in accordance with the planning intention of the Master Plan, Building Height Plan, or Special and Detailed Control Plan.

Balcony designs shall adhere to the following guidelines and submission requirements:

| Location | Balconies shall be located away from M&E areas to safeguard the quality and usability of these spaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Openness | Balconies shall have a continuous perimeter opening of at least 40%. ![Balcony Perimeter Opening](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F07_Balcony_Perimeter_Opening.jpg) The portions of a balcony that face a parapet wall (e.g., a wall between the balconies of two adjoining units) not exceeding 1.3m in height are considered "open". The QP shall show the computation of perimeter opening for the proposed balconies on the floor plans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Screen   | Balconies shall not be enclosed with walls or glass panels as balconies are meant to be semi-outdoor spaces. Balcony screens may be allowed provided: The balcony screens can be drawn open or retracted fully; and the balcony screens allow for natural ventilation/airflow within the balcony at all times, even when the screens are fully drawn. Balcony screens shall be designed upfront and approved as part of the Development Application process for all new hotel developments with proposed balconies (including the hotel component of mixed-use developments). Section cuts of the louvres shall be provided to show that the screening is naturally ventilated at all times, even when closed. For existing developments without balcony screens, screens may be installed provided they fulfill the performance criteria above. Safety grilles are not considered as balcony screens, and such installation does not require planning approval. |

### Rooftop ORA on Landscaped Roofs

Refer to the section on [Greenery](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Hotel/Greenery).

### Built Environment Transformation Scheme

The Built Environment (BE) Transformation GFA scheme aims to encourage adoption of higher tier Construction Industry Transformation Map (ITM) outcomes in areas of digitisation, productivity and sustainability. The incentive scheme is jointly administered by BCA and URA. Applicants may qualify for the scheme by adopting stipulated ITM outcomes as part of the development proposal.

#### Eligibility

The incentive is applicable for new erection or major Addition & Alterations to private sites of at least 5000sqm GFA(1). Sites launched under the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme prior to 31 March 2022 may also be eligible for the incentive scheme.

The types of developments eligible for the incentive scheme are as follows:

| Land Use        | Development Type                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Residential(2)  | Condominium and Flats development                                                                                                                             |
| Non-Residential | Commercial, Industrial and Institutional developments, such as office, retail, business parks, community building, hotel, hospital or white site developments |
| Mixed Use       | Combination of the above                                                                                                                                      |

##### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Smaller developments of less than 5,000 sqm GFA may be considered on a case-by-case basis if agencies determine that sizeable productivity and sustainability outcomes relative to the development proposal can be achieved based on BE ITM measures proposed by the developers.
- (2): The maximum allowable number of dwelling units for residential developments located outside of Central Area is derived from the Master Plan permissible intensity, which excludes any bonus GFA the site is eligible for.

#### Quantum of bonus GFA allowed

Private sites may be granted up to 3% bonus GFA under the scheme(3). The scheme is applicable for new proposals till 23 November 2026.

GLS sites are eligible up to 2% bonus GFA. The scheme is applicable for new GLS launched prior to 31 March 2022.

The cumulative bonus GFA shall be kept within the overall budget of 10% above the Master Plan Gross Plot Ratio (GPR), or the maximum allowable GFA of the development. It shall not form the future development potential of the site upon redevelopment.

The quantum of allowable bonus GFA under the BE Transformation Scheme is based on the proposed uses, use quantum that complies with the Master Plan zoning, and any additional requirements imposed as part of the endorsement for the bonus GFA.

Should development proposals fall within areas with specific planning considerations (e.g. storey height controls) or are unable to fully accommodate the additional intensity due to on-site conditions (e.g. areas with traffic concerns), the bonus GFA under the BE Transformation Scheme that can be approved may be lower than the endorsed quantum, and/or the bonus GFA may be limited to a particular use or uses.

##### Definitions and Notes

- (3): Applications submitted under the Strategic Development Incentive (SDI) and Central Business District (CBD) incentive schemes will have to comply with stipulated outcomes in the areas of digitalisation, productivity and sustainability. The required ITM outcomes will be separately assessed in relation to the context of the proposal, upon submission of the outline application for the SDI/CBDI development proposal. ITM outcomes will be imposed as conditions for planning approval for redevelopment proposals via the SDI/CBD Incentive scheme. SDI/CBDI proposals will not qualify for the additional GFA under the BE Transformation Gross Floor Area Incentive Scheme.

#### Submission

Applicants are to submit an application to BCA with supporting documents on the proposed ITM outcome concept plan and detail the proposed ITM outcome to be adopted for the development proposal. The submission can be made at this [link](https://form.gov.sg/610112199bdc0c00123abb25).

Following BCA’s grant of letter of acceptance, applicants shall submit the development proposal with the proposed quantum and use group of the proposed bonus BE Transformation GFA to URA, for detailed assessment. The development application shall be submitted within 6 months from BCA’s grant of Letter of Acceptance, and shall include a copy of the Letter of Acceptance, and the [BE Transformation GFA computation form](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/BE-Transformation-GFA-computation-form.pdf). The submission process and verification of ITM outcomes is summarised at this [link](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/BE-Transformation-Submission-process.pdf).

#### Requirements on ITM Outcomes for Bonus BE Transformation GFA

Applicants are to comply with BE ITM outcomes for the bonus scheme based on the [building type](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/BE-Transformation-building-type.pdf). The specific requirements for the development proposal will be shared in detail as part of the application process to BCA for the Letter of Acceptance.

### ORA within Privately-Owned Public Spaces (POPS)

Refer to the section on [POPS](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/gross-floor-area/GFA/Privately-OwnedPublicSpacesPOPS).

### Notes

Hotel developments may make use of any combination of the bonus GFA incentive schemes (ie Balcony Incentive Scheme and Rooftop ORA on Landscaped Roofs), as long as the cumulative bonus GFA does not exceed the overall cap of 10% above the MP GPR.

The bonus GFA allowed under the bonus incentive schemes is over and above the MP GPR and is subject to a maximum of 10% of the MP GPR. When the site is redeveloped in future, the additional GFA already used under the bonus GFA incentive schemes cannot be carried over. In other words, the GPR for the site shall revert to the GPR specified in the prevailing MP.

### Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH)

LUSH is a comprehensive urban and skyrise greening programme comprising both Landscape Replacement Areas (LRA) requirements and incentives to provide greenery and communal spaces.

The LRA requirements are calibrated by location, GPR and development type. A development may count Sky Terraces, Communal Planter Boxes and Covered Communal Ground Gardens (see Greenery sub-tabs) amongst other features, towards meeting the LRA requirement.

Applicants may refer to the following self-help checklists for the applicable greenery requirements and information to be submitted for assessment: for private developments [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Documents/LUSH-Checklist-For-Private-Developments.pdf) and public sector developments [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Documents/LUSH-Checklist-For-Public-Sector-Developments.pdf).

Landscape Replacement Areas

![Image 2: Landscape Replacement Areas](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F09_Landscape_Replacement_Small.jpg?h=580&w=1000)

#### Landscape Replacement Areas (LRA) Guidelines in Strategic Areas

Developments in identified Strategic Areas shall provide LRA that is minimally equivalent to the development’s gross site area, as shown in the table and diagram below. At least 40% of the LRA requirement shall be reserved for softscape (permanent planting) areas. The remaining LRA requirement may be provided as hardscape.

The Green Plot Ratio (GnPR) provides an objective measure of the density of greenery within a site. The formula for computing GnPR and the minimum GnPR requirement is as follows:

![Image 2: Green Plot Ratio formula](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/GnPR_Calculation.png?h=100%25&w=100%25)

The Total Leaf Area shall be computed based on the Leaf Area Index (LAI) for each plant species, canopy area (for trees and palms) and the quantity planted. The plant species sub-categories and LAI values may be obtained online from NParks’ [Flora Fauna Web](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb) by searching the common or scientific names of plants.

The LRA requirement is not applicable to conserved buildings in historic conservation areas. URA may exercise flexibility on LRA requirements when evaluating individual developments affected by specific constraints.

The table below shows the guidelines for computation of LRAs in Strategic Areas. LRA in Strategic Areas is the sum of:

- Horizontal surface area of the softscape eg permanent planting beds;
- Horizontal surface area of the hardscape eg communal facilities, urban farm; and
- Vertical surface area of green walls and extensive green roofs (if any).

| General Guidelines                        | To qualify as LRA, all horizontal areas shall be: unenclosed and open-to-sky, or if covered, open sided, naturally ventilated, and qualify for GFA exemption under a LUSH incentive scheme (eg Communal Planter Boxes, Covered Communal Ground Gardens and/or, Sky Terraces). Rooftop urban farms counted as GFA may be counted as LRA subject to the guidelines under the Hardscape Area section below. All LRA shall be designed taking into account safety and maintenance considerations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Softscape Areas                           | These are permanent, sunken planting areas which shall be designed with sufficient soil depth to accommodate a variety of plant types.A minimum soil depth of 1000mm shall be provided for trees and palms, 500mm for shrubs and climbers, and 300mm for ground covers. Potted plants do not count as softscape.As an alternative to providing sunken planting beds, building owners can provide well-landscaped, raised planting beds at maximum 300mm high, planted with trees or shrubs (ie no turfing allowed). This facilitates compliance with FSSD’s fire safety requirements on habitable space                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Hardscape Areas                           | These are communal facilities (eg event plazas, playgrounds and water features), surrounded by lush landscaping. Fire engine accessways may be considered as hardscape areas if they are communally accessible in times of non-emergency and are surrounded by lush landscaping. Covered Rooftop Urban Farms may count towards hardscape under the LRA requirement, up to 10% of site area and subject to the merits of the proposal. For crop protection, covers over rooftop urban farms may be allowed.Such covered urban farm area may be allowed on Temporary Permission and counted as Gross Floor Area, subject to SLA levying Land Betterment Charge, where applicable. URA may consider allowing additional GFA for farms over and above the maximum permissible GFA under the Master Plan.Prevailing building height controls shall continue to apply to any structures and equipment proposed at the roofs. Proposals within areas subject to Urban Design guidelines or Conservation requirements shall be evaluated according to prevailing controls. |
| Vertical Greenery & Extensive Green Roofs | May count towards either softscape or hardscape under the LRA requirement, up to 10% of site area. The following guidelines shall apply: Vertical greenery shall be publicly visible, e.g. placed at external building facade fronting key pedestrian thoroughfares, major public spaces, and main entrance areas, etc. Vertical greenery for sites in Urban Design areas eg Central Area and Key Growth areas (see the Urban Design Guidelines on URA SPACE) may be subject to additional urban design requirements. Extensive green roofs shall be of a substantial size to contribute to green cover and support biodiversity. Apart from maintenance purposes, extensive green roofs shall not be accessible for other users. Horizontal trellis-based greenery shall not qualify as extensive green roofs.For vertical green proposing support systems, planter boxes of minimum 500mm depth are encouraged to be provided at every storey for dense plant growth.                                                                                            |

| Clearance Process and Requirements        | URA’s clearance of the completed Landscape Replacement Areas provided by developments within Strategic Areas is required before the Commissioner of Building Control issues the Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP), or Certificate of Statutory Completion (CSC) (when TOP is not required). In your submission, please include accurately labelled photographs (in pdf file format) showing the completed Landscape Replacement Areas. URA will evaluate the photographs submitted and, if necessary, arrange for a site inspection before issuing the Clearance for the completed works. Applicants are also required to declare upfront to the Commissioner of Building Control at the point of application for TOP or CSC (when TOP is not required), that URA’s Clearance is required for Landscape Replacement Areas before issuance of TOP, or CSC (when TOP is not required).                                                                                                                                                                               |

##### LRA Guidelines outside the Strategic Areas

Outside of the Strategic Areas, all sites zoned Commercial, Residential with Commercial at 1st storey, Commercial and Residential, Hotel and White shall be required to meet minimum greening standards, tiered according to the development’s GPR as shown in the table below.

LRA Requirements for Developments Outside Strategic Areas

| LRA Requirements                               | GPR ≤ 1.4 | 1.4 < GPR < 2.8 | GPR ≥ 2.8 |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------- | --------- |
| Overall Greenery Provision (as % of Site Area) | 30        | 35              | 40        |
| Green Plot Ratio (Total Leaf Area/Site Area)   | 3         | 3.5             | 4         |

The Green Plot Ratio provides an objective measure of the density of greenery within a site. The formula for computing GnPR and the minimum GnPR requirement is as follows:

![Image 3: Green Plot Ratio formula](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/GnPR_Calculation.png?h=100%25&w=100%25)

The Total Leaf Area shall be computed based on the Leaf Area Index (LAI) for each plant species, canopy area (for trees and palms) and the quantity planted. The plant species sub-categories and LAI values may be obtained online from NParks’ [Flora Fauna Web](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb) by searching the common or scientific names of plants.

The general guidelines of LRA are shown in the table below. The computation of the LRAs outside the Strategic Areas is the sum of:

- Horizontal surface area of the softscape eg permanent planting beds; and
- Vertical surface area of green walls (if any).

| General Guidelines                        | To qualify as LRA, all horizontal areas shall be: unenclosed and open-to-sky, orIf covered, open sided, naturally ventilated, and qualify for GFA exemption under a LUSH incentive scheme (eg Communal Planter Boxes, Covered Communal Ground Gardens and/or, Sky Terraces). The LRA may be located on any storey of the development, and shall be accessible to the public and building occupants during normal operating hours.All LRA shall be designed taking into account safety and maintenance considerations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Softscape Areas                           | These are permanent, sunken planting areas which shall be designed with sufficient soil depth to accommodate a variety of plant types.A minimum soil depth of 1000mm shall be provided for trees and palms, 500mm for shrubs and climbers, and 300mm for ground covers. Potted plants do not count as softscape.\*As an alternative to providing sunken planting beds, building owners can provide well-landscaped, raised planting beds at maximum 300mm high, planted with trees or shrubs (ie no turfing allowed). This facilitates compliance with FSSD’s fire safety requirements on habitable space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Vertical Greenery & Extensive Green Roofs | May count towards either softscape or hardscape under the LRA requirement, up to 10% of site area.The following guidelines shall apply: Vertical greenery shall be publicly visible, eg placed at external building facade fronting key pedestrian thoroughfares, major public spaces, and main entrance areas, etc. Vertical greenery for sites in Urban Design areas eg Central Area and Key Growth areas (see the Urban Design Guidelines on URA SPACE) may be subject to additional urban design requirements.Extensive green roofs shall be of a substantial size to contribute to green cover and support biodiversity. Apart from maintenance purposes, extensive green roofs shall not be accessible for other users. Horizontal trellis-based greenery shall not qualify as extensive green roofs. For vertical green proposing support systems, planter boxes of minimum 500mm depth are encouraged to be provided at every storey for dense plant growth. |
| Areas that do not qualify as LRA          | Service facilities, eg vehicular drop-offs, drive ways, etc. and its ancillary greenery.Circulation areas, eg stairs, ramps, walkways, etc. and its ancillary greenery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Ownership                                 | In strata subdivided developments, the LRAs shall be part of common property. LRAs for hotels within mixed-use developments, however, may be attributed to the hotel strata should they be contiguous to other hotel uses and be adequately segregated from other uses.Building owners shall retain the required LRAs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

#### Plan Presentation Requirements for Landscape Replacement Areas

A Landscape Plan for all Landscape Replacement Areas shall be submitted together with the Development Application, as illustrated below.

_![Image 4: Example of a landscape plan](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F10_Example_of_Landscape_Plan.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)_

The plans shall include:

- Relevant plans, cross sections and perspectives with layouts of the softscape and hardscape areas. The softscape and hardscape areas shall be visually differentiated on plans with the following details:
  - Computations of the overall LRA, softscape areas and Green Plot Ratio;
  - Proposed schedule and annotation of plant species and paving materials;
  - Where relevant, annotations of ancillary uses eg Swimming Pool, BBQ Area, etc.;
  - Where relevant, annotations of the 45-degree line;
  - Short statement on the proposed maintenance and irrigation methods for the planting.

Label and package the landscape plans and sections separately from the rest of the floor plans, and separate the softscape and hardscape areas into different layers.

URA’s approval is required if there are changes to the softscape areas (eg planting and structure of the planting beds) and hardscape areas that result in an overall reduction in area for the required LRAs.

URA’s approval is not required for changes to the planting species as long as the softscape and Green Plot Ratio requirements are complied with.

The following table for GnPR computation shall be filled in and submitted together with the landscape plans.

### LUSH Incentives

The following incentive schemes can be used throughout the development to provide greenery and communal spaces.

#### Sky Terraces

Sky terraces are communal garden spaces provided at the intermediate storeys of a building.

To qualify for GFA exemption, sky terraces shall comply with the criteria in the following table.

##### Sky Terrace Area as % of Floor Plate

- Sky Terrace: Not applicable
- Predominant Sky Terrace: The sky terrace area within the 45-degree line occupies equal to or more than 60% of the floor plate.

##### Perimeter Openness

- Sky Terrace: At least 40% of the perimeter of the sky terrace is to remain open(1) and unenclosed.
- Predominant Sky Terrace: At least 60% of the perimeter of the sky terrace is open(1) and unenclosed.

Parapet walls shall not exceed 1.3m in height to be considered open.

##### Depth of Sky Terrace

The proposed depth of the sky terrace shall be minimally 5.0m throughout.

#### Landscaping

Plants shall be incorporated on permanent and preferably sunken planting, planned with sufficient soil depth based on the types of plants proposed. The planting shall be well externalised.

Some space shall be set aside for the provision of communal facilities and furniture to enhance the usage of the sky terrace.

As an alternative to providing sunken planting beds, building owners can provide well-landscaped, raised planting beds up to 300mm high, planted with trees or shrubs. This facilitates compliance with FSSD’s fire safety requirements on habitable space.

The sky terraces shall be designed with safety and maintainability provisions in mind.

##### Accessibility and Ownership

The sky terrace shall be accessible to all occupants of the building and there shall be at least one set of communal access via a lift or staircase serving the sky terrace. Secondary access to the sky terrace from strata units can be supported.

The layout of sky terrace floors shall be subject to evaluation to ensure that the sky terrace space is meant for communal use and is not treated as a privatised space. For sky terraces in residential developments that occupy less than 60% of the floor plates, the sky terraces shall serve a minimum of 2 strata units to ensure that they remain as communal space. They shall remain as common property in strata subdivided developments.

##### Drop Panels

Where proposed, drop panels at the perimeter shall be visually transparent and may be in the form of louvres, fins, transparent glass, or other sun shading/weather protective devices. The panel shall not exceed one third of the height of the external opening. The area of GFA exemption(2) as defined by a 45-degree line shall be taken from the underside of any permanent or opaque structure, and not from the underside of a drop panel.

##### Additional Height

- Sky Terrace: Not eligible.
- Predominant Sky Terrace: Refer to Additional Height for Predominant Sky Terrace Storey sub-section in the Residential and Non-Residential Handbooks.

##### GFA Exemption

- Sky Terrace: For sky terraces occupying less than 60% of the floor plate, the maximum area for GFA exemption of the sky terrace is defined by the area covered by a 45-degree line taken from the edge of the overhead projection.
- Predominant Sky Terrace: URA may grant additional GFA exemption for residual areas beyond the 45-degree line (capped at 20% of the floor plate area), if such areas form an integral part of the sky terrace or are part of the barrier-free/fire escape corridors.

Corridors may be exempted from GFA computation for all sky terraces regardless of size subject to the following criteria:

- The corridor lies within the 45-degree exemption area;
- The corridor serves the sky terrace; and
- At least 40% of the perimeter of the sky terrace is to remain open(1) and unenclosed.
- The corridor does not serve as the primary access to units located on the same floor as the sky terrace.

##### Submission Requirements

A Landscape Plan and relevant sections for the sky terrace showing the proposed landscaping scheme, planting palette, soil depth and communal facilities shall be submitted as part of the Development Application.

##### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Parapet walls shall not exceed 1.3m in height to allow for more openness.
- (2): The 45-degree GFA exemption area may be taken from all external parapet walls (including recessed external parapet walls) surrounding the sky terrace.

Typical Landscape Plan

![Typical Landscape Plan](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/F11-Example-of-Landscape-Plan_final.jpg)

#### Communal Planter Boxes

Communal planter boxes shall comply with the following criteria:

- Maximum width of 1m;
- Minimum depth of 500mm (for planting purpose);
- To be sufficiently externalized.

Communal planter boxes which are more than 1.0m wide may be allowed if the wider planter boxes are part of an overall scheme with design merit.

Details of the communal planter boxes, including planting palette, spot sections showing soil depth, and dimensions shall be provided as part of the storey plans.

Communal planter boxes shall be designed with safety and maintainability provisions in mind.

#### Covered Communal Ground Gardens

Covered Communal Ground Gardens (C2G2) are on-ground greenery spaces at the 1st storey. The garden should flow seamlessly between the covered and uncovered spaces of the 1st storey and designed to be bright and airy with quality landscaping. There are two types of C2G2:

1.  Predominant C2G2s shall occupy at least 50% of the first storey building footprint. Within the covered garden area, a minimum of 60% shall be lushly landscaped, while the remaining 40% can be set aside for meaningful communal gathering and activity spaces, and unenclosed communal facilities. These spaces may include garden paths, playgrounds, and covered pools. Covered drop-off points may be considered as part of the C2G2 if well-integrated, paved with appropriate material and integrated with lush landscaping.
2.  Secondary C2G2 are communal landscaped areas on the 1st storey which are shaded by a structure or a floor or overhang above. These may be exempted from GFA computation up to a maximum area defined by a 45-degree line taken from the edge of the overhead projection. The GFA-exempted communal areas within the 45-degree line shall contain quality lush landscaping with a variety of vegetation.

All areas of C2G2 spaces shall be easily accessible to the public and/or building users during normal opening hours for the development. The communal ground garden shall not be easily enclosed and converted to any other uses in the future.

For GFA exemption for C2G2, refer to the [GFA handbook](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/gross-floor-area). URA will assess the C2G2’s design, spatial quality and overall integration with the wider landscaping scheme in considering the proposal’s eligibility for GFA exemption.

A landscape plan shall be submitted as part of the Development Application for the predominant covered ground garden proposal, showing the proposed landscaping scheme.

[](#Communal-Pavilions)

#### Communal Pavilions

Communal pavilions are small-scale, ancillary landscaping features that function as sheltered, open-sided resting points. Access to the pavilions shall be from the common areas only.

In addition to being sited within lushly landscaped areas, they shall satisfy the criteria below to qualify for GFA exemption:

| Rooftop      | Rooftops shall remain open-to-sky unless otherwise approved by URA. Where rooftop pavilions are allowed, they shall comply with the following requirements: Maximum 500sqm\* or 50% of roof coverage, whichever is lower. For developments which have reached the allowable storey height control, the pavilions shall remain open-sided when viewed externally. This is to ensure that the pavilions do not form an additional storey. For developments which have not reached the allowable storey height or are not located within areas subject to storey height control, maximum 50% perimeter enclosure of the rooftop pavilions may be allowed. Greenery on the rooftop shall be both enjoyable by the building users and visible from the surroundings. Plants shall be incorporated on permanent and preferably sunken planting, planned with sufficient soil depth based on the types of plants proposed. Some space shall be set aside for the provision of communal facilities and furniture to enhance the rooftop. |

##### Definitions and Notes:

- \*: The area is defined as the area of pavilion measured up to the roof eaves line.

A Landscape Plan and relevant sections for ground/rooftop spaces containing communal pavilions, showing the proposed landscaping scheme, pavilion dimensions, planting palette, soil depth, communal facilities, shall be submitted with the Development Application.

## Gross Plot Ratio
---
title: Gross Plot Ratio
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Hotel/Gross-Plot-Ratio
date: 5 July 2019
---

The allowable Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) of a hotel development is specified in the Master Plan. The GPR is the upper bound as it may not always be achievable because of site limitations like the shape of the plot, site topography, or ground conditions, building setbacks, building height, or technical requirements of other authorities that may affect the site.

If the GPR is not specified in the Master Plan, the allowable GPR would be determined taking into consideration the location, site context, traffic, and the impact of the hotel development on the surroundings.

The area of the land required to be set aside for Drainage Reserve(1) (DR) and/or Road Reserve(2) (RR) to be vested in the State may be included in the site area to compute the gross floor area (GFA) for a GPR – see figure below.

GPR for sites where vesting is required

### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Drainage Reserve (DR): An area safeguarded for purposes of building or widening a public drain
- (2): Road Reserve (RR): The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

Hotel developments, regulated under the Hotels Licensing Act, are primarily public accommodation facilities for a commercial purpose. While Hotels are predominantly used as accommodation, other limited supporting commercial uses such as shops, restaurants, and bars may be allowed.

Only the commercial use component within a hotel development may be strata subdivided.

Backpackers' hostels, regulated under the Hotels Licensing Act, are also public accommodation facilities for a commercial purpose. They are open concept dormitories for boarding and lodging purposes, with a minimum of 6 beds per room. Refer [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Property/Business/Change-Use-of-Property-for-Business/Assessment-Criteria) for the guidelines and requirements for the conversion of an existing property to a backpackers' hostel which may be allowed on temporary planning permission.



## Location

Hotel developments are allowed on land zoned "Hotel" in the Master Plan although some existing hotels approved some time ago may be occupying land currently not zoned Hotel.

Hotel developments located on land zoned Hotel or land zoned for other uses with a requirement to provide a minimum hotel quantum in the Master Plan are not allowed to be converted to other uses.

Hotel developments and backpackers' hostels may be considered on land that are not zoned for Hotel use in the Master Plan. Such cases shall be evaluated individually, taking into account the planning intention and compatibility with the surrounding land uses.

Areas where new hotel developments and backpackers' hostels are not allowed can be found [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2018/Jun/dc18-04/dc18-04-AppA.pdf) (PDF, 12.9 MB).



## Parking
---
title: Parking
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Hotel/Parking
date: 22 February 2024
---

LTA prescribes the parking provision standards and requirements for motor vehicles and bicycles. The requirements are usually based on the quantum of the gross floor area or the number of units of the development uses. LTA may require the provision of coach parking bays in hotel developments.

### Car and Motor-Cycle Parking

Under LTA’s Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS), developments are subject to car and motor-cycle(1) parking provision requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved plans, all car and motor-cycle parking lots shall be treated as common property.

#### Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS)

The RPPS allows developments to provide any level of car and motor-cycle parking provision within a specified range, defined by a lower bound and an upper bound – see figure below. The range varies according to location zones and land uses. Details may be found in [LTA’s Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html).

Range-based Parking Provision Standards:

![Range-based Parking Provision Standards](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Range_Based_Car_Parking_Standard.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

#### Provision of Surplus Parking in New Developments

New hotel and mixed use(2) developments shall be subject to a process of waiver evaluation by LTA, if one wishes to provide surplus car and motor-cycle parking lots, ie parking provision above the upper bound based on the new RPPS.

If LTA approves the waiver, each surplus car parking lot shall be computed as 35sqm GFA, that being the average area of a car parking lot inclusive of circulation space. Each surplus motor-cycle parking lot shall be computed as 12sqm GFA.

Additional GFA arising from the surplus car and motor-cycle parking lots may be subject to SLA levying Land Betterment Charge, where applicable.

#### Conversion of Surplus Car Parking in Existing Developments

Existing hotel developments within the [Central Area](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/Central_Area_Map_1.pdf) or within 400m of MRT and LRT stations may be allowed to permanently convert their surplus car parking lots(3) to other uses.

LTA may consider conversion of car parks up to the lower bound as stipulated in the RPPS. Interested building owners are to arrange for a pre-application consultation with LTA before submitting a development application to URA.

The conversion of surplus car park may be allowed subject to compliance with ALL of the following:

- The proposed uses shall be in line with the Master Plan zoning for the site and the planning intention for the surrounding area. The detailed uses and any changes to the building form and design shall be subject to evaluation by URA and the relevant agencies.
- The existing infrastructure and traffic network shall be able to support the increase in GFA and uses, and take into consideration proposed measures to mitigate traffic - generation.
- The resultant car parking provision shall be able to support the additional GFA and proposed uses.
- Additional GFA arising from the conversion may be subject to SLA levying Land Betterment Charge, where applicable. The additional GFA arising from the conversion of surplus car parking, detailed uses and any changes to the building form and design shall be subject to evaluation by URA and the relevant agencies.
- Requests for conversion of surplus car parks may not be supported for sites where there are specific conditions imposed in planning approval or the government land sale - that restrict the conversion of the surplus car parking spaces, or sites located within or adjacent to Conservation Areas where additional car parking spaces are needed to support the uses within the conserved buildings.

Additional GFA gained via the conversion of surplus car parking spaces shall not be taken into consideration in determining the maximum permissible intensity that may be allowed for the re-development of the site.

Where surplus car parking spaces were allowed by LTA through a waiver application to exceed the upper bound of the Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS) after 1 Feb 2019, the development will not be allowed to convert any of the surplus car parking spaces to other uses.

##### Conversion of Surplus Car Parking Spaces within Central Area

In line with the planning intention to encourage conversion of office developments to Residential, Hotel and other mixed uses within the CBD, only applications for conversion of existing surplus car parking spaces to non-office uses (see examples in the table below) will be considered in selected areas where [CBD Incentive Scheme](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Data/circulars/2019/Mar/dc19-04) applies.

For the rest of the Central Area, conversion of surplus car parking spaces to non-office uses is also highly encouraged, in line with the planning intention to inject more live-in population in the city.

| Locality                                                                                                                                                          | Allowable Change-of-Use for Surplus Carparks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Motor-cycle parking provision is mandatory in all non-residential developments.
- (2): Developments with commercial and/or hotel components that form more than 20% of the total GFA
- (3): With the RPPS, surplus car parking lots in existing developments may arise if the upper bound for the development type is revised downward and/or if developments choose to reduce car parking provision to the lower bound set out by the RPPS.
- (4): This is not an exhaustive list. Allowable uses will be subject to planning evaluation and will therefore vary from site to site.

### Bicycle Parking

To promote a car-lite society, hotel and mixed use developments shall provide bicycle parking facilities within the developments. Refer to LTA’s Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html) for the list of requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved plans, all bicycle parking lots shall be treated as common property.

Bicycle parking lots provided according to LTA’s new standards are exempted from GFA computation. Surplus provision of bicycle parking lots may be exempted from GFA computation depending on merits and context of the development.

### Loading Bay

We advise all building owners, developers and QPs to refer to the [Loading Bay Design and Operations Best Practice Guide](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2020/Jul/dc20-05---Guideline.pdf) when developing new hotel buildings or when redeveloping existing hotel buildings, especially for buildings with large retail components.

This guide provides information, best practices and recommendations regarding the design and operation of the loading bays within hotel buildings, to achieve the following objectives:

- Efficient loading/unloading turnaround time
- Improve traffic safety and goods flow
- Adapt to changing delivery trends

In cases where it is difficult to adhere to the good practice for the design and operation of the loading bays, we encourage buildings owners to explore other means to achieve the same design and operation principles.



## RC Flat Roofs
---
title: RC Flat Roofs
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Hotel/RC-Flat-Roofs
date: 22 February 2024
---

### Introduction

RC flat roofs shall remain inaccessible except for maintenance purposes only(1). Activating the rooftop for uses such as roof terraces and landscaped gardens may be allowed depending on the merits of the proposal. No structures shall be allowed unless otherwise approved by URA. Where allowed, structures (including any safety barriers) shall comply with height controls(2) and the following guidelines.

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): RC flat roofs that are accessible via ladders for maintenance purposes only are subject to agencies’ requirements for safety barriers to ensure the safety of maintenance personnel. Safety barriers shall not exceed 1m in height.
- (2): Height controls applicable, include:
  - Absolute technical height constraints(@) (e.g. Aviation paths restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).
  - Conservation guidelines (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
  - Urban design height controls (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
- (@): The absolute technical height (Based on Singapore Height Datum [SHD]) shall take precedence if it is stricter than any of the other height controls.

### Communal Pavilions

Communal pavilions are small-scale, ancillary landscaping features that function as sheltered, open-sided resting points. Access to communal pavilions shall be from common areas only. The pavilions shall be computed as GFA unless they meet the following criteria:

- Maximum 500sqm(1) or 50% of roof coverage, whichever is lower.
- For developments which have reached the allowable storey height control, the pavilions shall remain open-sided when viewed externally. This is to ensure that the pavilions do not form an additional storey.
- For developments which have not reached the allowable storey height or are not located within areas subject to storey height control, maximum 50% perimeter enclosure of the rooftop pavilions may be allowed.
- Communal pavilions shall be integrated with lush greenery. The greenery on the rooftop shall be both enjoyable by the building users and visible from the surroundings.
- Plants shall be incorporated on permanent and preferably sunken planting, planned with sufficient soil depth based on the types of plants proposed. Some space shall be set aside for the provision of communal facilities and furniture to enhance the rooftop.
- A Landscape Plan and relevant sections for ground/rooftop spaces containing communal pavilions, showing the proposed landscaping scheme, pavilion dimensions, planting palette, soil depth, communal facilities, shall be submitted with the Development Application.

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): The area is defined as the area of pavilion measured up to the roof eaves line.

### Solar Panels

The installation of solar panels on RC flat roofs may be considered if they meet the following criteria:

- a. Solar panels are installed between 10 to 15 degrees relative to the horizontal plane to optimise the performance of solar panels and minimise glare to the buildings in the vicinity; and
- b. The installation of solar panels shall not result in the removal of any greenery approved under the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH) Programme.

Installation of solar panels and M&E equipment such as inverters for the solar panel system does not require planning permission except in locations and contexts described below.

#### Planning Permission

- a. **Areas subject to urban design guidelines and Conservation Areas(2) shall require planning permission due to their impact on the roofscape.**

- b. **Elevated solar panels(3) located in developments on the following land use zones shall require planning permission:**

  - Residential (landed housing, flats and condominium housing developments)
  - Residential with Commercial at 1st Storey
  - Mixed Commercial & Residential
  - Commercial
  - Hotel
  - White
  - Residential / Institution
  - Commercial / Institution
  - Educational Institution
  - Place of Worship
  - Civic & Community Institution

- c. **Spaces under solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial use**
  - Planning permission shall be required if the spaces under elevated or non-elevated solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial uses such as Outdoor Refreshment Areas. In such instances, the spaces shall be computed as GFA.

#### Assessment of Storey Height

Elevated solar panels that require planning permission may be assessed as an additional storey for storey height control purposes unless they comply with the guidelines below:

Guidelines for Elevated Solar Panels

| **Parameter** | **Guidelines**                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Extent        | Within the 45-degree line from the springing line of the roof level |
| Height        | Maximum 5m above roof level                                         |

![Extent and Height of Elevated Solar Panels](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/GFA54_Solar_Panels_Buildings.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

#### Definitions and Notes

- (2): For Conservation Areas, installation of solar panels without any additional works are treated as localised works for the purpose of repair and maintenance and are considered Category 3 works for Conserved Buildings. Applications for such Category 3 works can be made by owners and contractors. Refer to the Conservation Guidelines [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation) and information on submission procedure [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation/Additions-Alterations/Types-Works).
- (3): A solar panel is deemed to be elevated if it is raised more than 1m from the roof level for landed housing developments or 1.8m from the roof level for other developments.

title: Special and Detailed Control Plans
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Hotel/SDCP
date: 13 April 2020
---

Special and Detailed Control Plans (SDCP) provide detailed guidelines for specific areas. The SDCPs may be viewed [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/index.html?service=CTRLPLAN).

### Special Control Areas

The following areas may be subject to security screening requirements. URA will confirm this upon submission of a proposed development.

Special Control Area 1

![LSpecial Control Area 1 Image](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Special-Control-Area-1.jpg?h=416&w=750)

Special Control Area 2

[Link to Special Control Area 2 Image](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Special-Control-Area-2.jpg?h=383&w=750)

Qualified Persons (QPs) should consider the screening requirements in the early stage of their planning and design to avoid abortive work subsequently.

Where security screening is deemed necessary, it shall consist of permanent fixtures that are difficult, if not impossible to remove. The following screening measures may be considered:

#### Visual Screening

Residential units and common areas may be screened where necessary with blank walls, external concrete/metal fins, or the building may be re-orientated such that the windows(1)/openings/balconies do not have direct view towards the protected area.

##### Definitions and Notes

- (1) Window: Raised openings that are at least 0.9m above the floor slab. They are intended to provide ventilation and lighting, and not for access. Full height windows and windows that are lower than 0.9m that can potentially be used as access points will need to be highlighted in the submission plans for URA’s evaluation and approval.

#### Roof Screening

The parapet wall at the rooftop shall be at least 3m high and access to the rooftop from a public area shall be secured by a lockable door/hatch. The door/hatch may be electronically linked to an alarm system monitored by the building management.

## Urban Design Requirements
---
title: Urban Design Requirements
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Hotel/UD
date: 22 October 2019
---

Guidelines on Urban Design (UD) intentions are to preserve and enhance the urban character of the different planning areas. They help to ensure that developments integrate well with their surrounding urban environment.

### Specific Urban Design Requirements

Developments in Central Area and Key Growth areas, such as Jurong Gateway, Paya Lebar Central, Punggol Digital District, and Woodlands Central, may be guided by specific [urban design requirements](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design) where the planning intention is to introduce activity-generating uses. These urban design requirements shall take precedence over the standard development control parameters. Refer to [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design/URA-SPACE/UD-URA-SPACE) for the Urban Design Guidelines Plan and designated AGU areas.

### Activity Generating Uses (AGUs)

AGUs help to activate and enliven streets; contributing to its vibrancy, providing key basic amenities, and attracting visitor-ship to the precincts. The following situations may require AGUs:

- a. Urban Design Areas shown in the Special and Detailed Control Plan (SDCP) Street Block and Urban Design Plan;
- b. Government Land Sale (GLS) sites where AGUs are required as part of the Technical Conditions of Tender;
- c. Sites that undergo redevelopment or major A&A works and where AGUs are required as part of the planning conditions issued for these works;
- d. Other areas as directed and specified by the Competent Authority.

AGUs may be required to be provided in the following typical locations:

- a. 1st storey of developments fronting key streets, pedestrian malls, through block links, and public spaces;
- b. Alongside underground pedestrian links (UPLs) at the basement levels of the developments;
- c. Alongside elevated pedestrian links (EPLs) at the 2nd storey of the developments.

The proposed AGUs in the above locations are to be assessed contextually, taking into account the planning intention for the area and potential amenity problems that will impact on the surrounding developments. Uses not allowed are those that do not directly contribute to street vibrancy and/or can potentially cause amenity problems to neighbours.

#### Example of uses that may be considered as Activity Generating Uses (AGUs) are:

- Shop
- Showroom/ galleries
- Restaurant
- Pet shop/pet grooming
- Banks, adjoining or independent ATM clusters
- Commercial school
- Childcare centre/kindergarten
- Gym/fitness centre
- Visitor Centre/ museum
- Hotel/ Backpackers’ hostel
- Self-service laundry

#### The following uses are not AGUs:

- Office
- Bar
- Nightclub
- Massage establishment
- LAN gaming centre



## Underground Pedestrian Links (UPL) to Rapid Transit System (RTS) Stations

title: Underground Pedestrian Links (UPL) to Rapid Transit System (RTS) Stations
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Hotel/UPL
date: 21 November 2022
---

To improve the overall connectivity network, building owners/developers are encouraged to construct direct subterranean connections from nearby developments to existing and future RTS stations. The UPL shall form part of the public circulation network, designed to be barrier-free, and be directly accessible from common public areas during the operating hours of the RTS.

### Use

Activity-generating uses such as shops and eating establishments shall be incorporated along one or both sides of the UPL linking to the RTS station.

### Opening Hours

The UPL shall be open during operating hours of the RTS station/normal business operation hours for public use. Signage indicating opening hours shall be provided at the entrances of the link.

### Size

- The UPL shall provide a clear walkway width of 6 – 7m for UPLs without shops or with single-loaded uses:

![Width of underground pedestrian walkway with single-loaded uses](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C18_Underground_Link_A.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

- 7m for a UPLs with double-loaded uses:

![Width of underground pedestrian walkway with double-loaded uses](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C19_Underground_Link_B.jpg?h=1896&w=3022)

- The UPL shall provide a clear minimum ceiling height of 4m.
- The activity-generating uses may be allowed a maximum total depth of 14m.

### GFA

- Given its function as a public thoroughfare, the walkway of the UPL may be exempted from GFA computation subject to the compliance with the criteria above. For walkways more than 7m wide, GFA exemption may be considered depending on the merits of the proposal.
- The activity-generating use shall be computed as GFA and may be computed over and above the allowable GPR as stipulated in the prevailing Master Plan or permissible GFA for the development.
- The GFA for this additional commercial space is not transferrable and shall not form the future development potential of the site upon redevelopment.
- Additional GFA from activity-generating use may be subject to SLA levying Land Betterment Charge, where applicable.

### Submission Plans

- Properly annotated plans and sections showing the proposed UPL in relation to the adjoining developments and nearby RTS station shall be submitted for evaluation by URA.
- Since a UPL will occupy State land, the developer/owner shall obtain SLA’s endorsement for the submitted plans.

Developments not listed in the table above may also be required to submit a WCP if they fall under the following criteria:

- Developments located in car-lite precincts(4); or
- Developments located within 400m of major transport nodes, ie within Zone 2(5); or
- Retail, Office, Mixed Use developments.

Applicants of developments meeting the above criteria are strongly encouraged to check in early with LTA for the requirement of a WCP. See the diagram below for the submission flowchart to LTA and URA.

![Submission Flowchart](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Others/WCP.jpg)

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1) Developments that have a master developer, and consist of two or more plots that staged at different time will also be required to submit a WCP at the concept design stage.
- (2) LTA and URA will work with HDB on the WCP requirements.
- (3) Only industrial developments located within car-lite precincts or 400m of major transport nodes ie within Zone 2, will be required to submit a WCP.
- (4) The five car-lite precincts are Bayshore, Jurong Lake District, Kampong Bugis, Marina South and Woodlands North.
- (5) Zone 2 as defined in the Zonal Car Parking requirement in the Code of Practice on Vehicle Parking Provision in Development proposals. Please refer to [LTA's website](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/vehicle-parking.html) for more details.

### Design of WCP

The WCP shall consider the safety, convenience, and accessibility of pedestrians and cyclists, and incorporate the following elements in the design of the development:

- Provision of convenient and direct access from nearby public transport facilities and adjacent developments;
- Provision of measures to minimise conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and motor vehicles at locations such as the vehicular ingress/egress, car park entrances, and drop-off points;
- Provision of sufficient and conveniently located bicycle parking spaces and supporting amenities such as shower facilities and lockers;
- Provision of way-finding signage to public transport facilities and amenities for cyclists; and
- Provision of barrier-free access and routes for children, elderly and the mobility challenged groups.

The detailed guidelines on WCP and submission requirements are summarised in LTA's Code of Practice ["Street Work Proposals Relating to Development Works"](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/street-proposals.html).

To provide assistance on developing active mobility-related infrastructure in a holistic manner, a Walking & Cycling Design Guide has been produced as a supplement to the respective agencies' prevailing COPs, engineering and development standards. The Guide can be downloaded [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/walk-cycle-ride/WCP.html).

To maintain the integrity and aesthetics of the waterfront areas so that the public can have free and unrestricted access to enjoy these spaces, developments at major waterbodies(1) shall observe the design and development application submission guidelines below.

![Waterbodies Image 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C16_Waterbodies_1.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

![Waterbodies Image 2](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C17_Waterbodies_2.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

### Design Guidelines

1. Retaining Walls

   - Retaining walls along the waterbodies may be allowed subject to the following criteria:
     - a. Retaining walls are less than 1.5m in height;
     - b. Retaining walls are set back at least 300mm from the boundary;
     - c. Retaining walls are covered with creepers.

2. Boundary Walls/Fences

   - For non-industrial developments, proposed boundary fences shall be porous (eg chained-link, metal-grille, or timber fence).
   - For industrial developments, the following may be allowed:
     - a. Solid boundary walls not exceeding 1.8m in height. The walls shall be aesthetically treated.
     - b. Chain-linked fences not exceeding 1.8m in height with close planting of shrubs/vegetation as screenings. A planting strip of 0.5m width (minimum) shall be provided within the development.

3. Slope

   - There shall be no abrupt change in slope gradient at the boundary between the development and the waterbody. The slope gradient shall not exceed 1:2.

4. Conservation of Vegetation

   - Mature vegetation along the waterbodies are to be saved and conserved, wherever possible.

### Development Application Submission Guidelines

In all waterbodies-related development application submissions to URA, the following shall be provided, where applicable:

- Site/Location Plan showing the width and alignment of Drainage Reserve(2)/Waterbody/Coastal Profile;
- Layout plans and cross-sections showing the area between the site and the Drainage Reserve/Waterbody/Coastal Area including existing and proposed ground levels;
- Design details of integration with waterbody including slope, retaining wall, and boundary wall/fencing (Height, Type, Screening);
- Contour lines extending to 1m beyond the side of development fronting the Drainage Reserve/Waterbody/Sea;
- [Checklist](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/User-Defined/URA-Online/Forms/Supplementary-forms/waterbodycl.doc) for Waterbodies-related proposals.

### Application of Guidelines

The design guidelines listed above shall apply to all developments adjacent to or with waterbodies except developments adjacent to or with Drainage Reserves less than 17.5m.

All proposals involving waterbodies shall comply with the development application submission guidelines listed above.

#### Additional Guidelines for Use of Foreshore by Developments with a Frontage to the Sea

For land use planning and development control purposes, the foreshore(3) and the area within 15m on both the landward and seaward side of the foreshore line(4) shall be kept free of structures. Some structures such as ramps may be permitted if they are constructed in connection with an approved development (e.g., marine industries, refineries, and pleasure-boat storage complex). These structures are subject to planning evaluation depending on merits.
