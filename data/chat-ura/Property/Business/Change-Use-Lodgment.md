The Change of Use Lodgment Scheme allows certain uses in selected buildings to be granted instant approval upon an application with URA.

Proposals that do not qualify under the Lodgment Scheme will have to submit a planning application through a ![Change of Use application](<https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/browse-all-licences/urban-redevelopment-authority-(ura)/change-of-use-approval>).
