Depending on your business use and the type of property you have in mind, you may need to apply for planning permission. For example, you want to set up a restaurant in a particular commercial building. Use this list to find out if you need to apply for planning permission.

There are certain designated areas and locations where the planning intention is to introduce activity generating uses (AGU). This is to activate and enliven streets by contributing to its vibrancy, and attracting visitorship to precincts. Learn more about AGU requirements from the Urban Design Requirements tab in the respective [DC Handbook](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential) or your development type. Check [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design/URA-SPACE/UD-URA-SPACE) to find out whether your property is within an AGU area.

Select your business use below to find out where your business can be allowed.

### Why do you need to apply for planning permission to change the use of a premises?

Changing an approved use of a premises to another use may cause amenity problems to neighbouring premises in the area. A planning application for change of use would allow URA to assess if the intended new use is compatible and acceptable.

We work with other licensing agencies such as the Land Transport Authority (LTA), Singapore Police Force (SPF), and National Environment Agency (NEA) to ensure that the proposal can meet their requirements in addition to planning and land use considerations.

After a change of use approval is obtained, you are required to apply for the necessary permits and licences separately from the relevant government agencies throughÂ [GoBusiness Singapore](<https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/browse-all-licences/urban-redevelopment-authority-/(ura/)/change-of-use-approval>).
