Depending on your business use and the type of property you have in mind, you may need to apply for planning permission. For example, you want to set up a restaurant in a particular commercial building. Use this list to find out if you need to apply for planning permission.

There are certain designated areas and locations where the planning intention is to introduce activity generating uses (AGU). This is to activate and enliven streets by contributing to its vibrancy, and attracting visitorship to precincts. Learn more about AGU requirements from the Urban Design Requirements tab in the respective DC Handbook or your development type. Check URA SPACE to find out whether your property is within an AGU area.
