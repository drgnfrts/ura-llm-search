Internal works within your flat, condominium or strata landed unit do not require planning permission when there is no increase in Gross Floor Area (GFA) and the premises continues to function as a self-sufficient residential unit with the essential communal spaces and amenities.

Find out whether your home improvement works require planning permission and learn about the relevant guidelines.

[Internal Partitioning Works](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Property/Residential/Renovating-private-residential-property/Strata-titled-residential#Internal-Partitioning-Works)

Internal partitioning works within a residential unit can be allowed without planning permission from URA if the unit continues to retain a self-sufficient layout with essential communal spaces and amenities. This means the residential unit should generally maintain a regular-sized living/dining area of 20sqm in size and 3m in width or larger. The original layout of spaces like kitchens, service yards and balconies etc. should also be retained and these spaces are to be excluded from the living/dining area computation.
