## [Buying Property](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Property/Residential/Buying-Property)

When buying a private residential property, ensure that it does not have any unauthorised works and extensions or is currently not used inappropriately. Otherwise you may be liable for them after taking over the property.

1.  Ask the seller for a copy of approved plans, or
2.  [Submit DC15 - Requisition of Planning Records](https://www.ura.gov.sg/buyplanningrecords) to URA to obtain a copy of the approved plans.

If you are planning to renovate or redevelop after buying the property, you should also check what the approved plans are.

## [Short-Term Accommodation](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Property/Residential/Short-Term-Accommodation)

All residential properties in Singapore (e.g. condominiums, walk up apartments, flats, bungalows, semi-detached and terrace houses) are intended for long-term residence.

Under the law, they are not allowed to be used for short-term accommodation – defined as stays of less than three consecutive months. An example of short-term accommodation is when short-term visitors, such as tourists, book and stay at such properties for a few days.
